# Hi there!

Let's just keep adding more solutions (and more questions), it helps in making your GitHub calender greener along with increased problem solving abilities.

- Add your own solutions only, try not to copy from ChatGPT or Bard.
- Naming convention for the solution source file should be like this: "name_surname.c" or "your-github-username.c", and solution files should only be added in the `soltuions` folder just like questions should go into the `problem-statements` folder.
- Let the peers review your code, and create new issues for solutions with flaws
- Add new PRs for new questions

## But why do it at all?

Instead of just sending the solution in dm or a group chat in WhatsApp, why go through all of this hardwork?

As you can see, in the process of uploading your solution, **you are learning how to use git and github**, and frankly, this is how you'll be able to contribute to any open-source project in the existence (unless you happen to live in their servers).

Software delopment without git (or any version control) is like *running a marathon barefoot, blindfolded and juggling chainsaws*, so if by any means you are interested in software development, git is a tool you must learn!
